        ### DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!
        
        This is important. Drag and drop your log files here. `%VINTAGE_STORY_DATA%\Logs`
        
        The best way to do this is to launch the game, log into your world, make it crash, and then zip your **__ENTIRE__** Logs folder, and drag it into this report. This will allow us to sift through the logs and see exactly what was happening at the time of the crash. Without a copy of your **__ENTIRE__** Logs folder, we cannot do anything to troubleshoot your issue.
