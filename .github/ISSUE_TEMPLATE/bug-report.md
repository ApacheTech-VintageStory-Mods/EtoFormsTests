# 🐛 Bug Report

<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue here -->

## 💻 Screenshots / Stack Trace

<!-- Please provide steps to reproduce the issue and/or screenshots of the issue, or stack trace results. -->

## 🌍 **Log Files**

### DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!

This is important. Drag and drop your log files here. `%VINTAGE_STORY_DATA%\Logs`

The best way to do this is to launch the game, log into your world, make it crash, and then zip your **__ENTIRE__** Logs folder, and drag it into this report. This will allow us to sift through the logs, and see exactly what was happening at the time of the crash. Without a copy of your **__ENTIRE__** Logs folder, we cannot do anything to troubleshoot your issue.

<!-- Drag and drop your zip file here. -->
